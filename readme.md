# TODO
- network manager - in progress
  - handling players leaving the game with tcp - now it's done with udp
- player - ball collisions
- score
- waiting for a game (players can join and get assigned to team) - warmup
- server commands - e.g. end warmup, restart game etc.
- better serialization (right now it's json - it can be too much data to handle many players)
- server deployment

# FIx
- lagging ball (other players prob too)
- you can grab the ball from the others (again :[)

# Nice to have
- client side prediction
- web client (webRTC?)
