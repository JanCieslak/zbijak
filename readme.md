# TODO
- player spawning on their side (server command)
- player - ball collisions (TODO in code)
- score
- waiting for a game (players can join and get assigned to team) - warmup
- server commands - e.g. end warmup, restart game etc.
- better serialization (right now it's json - it can be too much data to handle many players)
- server deployment

# Fix
- lagging ball players too (or just my pc :[)
- you can grab the ball from the others (again :[)

# Nice to have
- client side prediction
- web client (webRTC?)
